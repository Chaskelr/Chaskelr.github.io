<h1>Finding Range Estimates: Data Policy</h1>
<p>Dear participant,</p>
<p>The research project “Finding Range Estimates” (conducted as part of the TRR 266 project B04) aims to investigate how people come up with and judge others’ range estimates. It is an experimental study conducted by:</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px; line-height: 0%">Humboldt University of Berlin<p>

<p style="text-indent:20px; line-height: 0%">Email: chaskelr@hu-berlin.de<p>
<p>In the following, I inform you about the handling of your personal data in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR). I kindly ask for your consent to participate in the experiment and to process your responses for the purposes specified. Please read the following information carefully. If you have any questions or difficulties in understanding, please contact me via chaskelr@hu-berlin.de. Responses are processed in accordance with the information obligations pursuant to Art. 13 EU GDPR.<p>
<p>I do <b>not</b> collect email-addresses, names, or IP addresses. I do <b>not</b> store cookies on participants’ devices. I <b>do</b> collect the time that participants start the experiment and end the experiment. Participants are free to skip questions related to demographic information (most importantly age group and gender).<p>
<p>Data will first be pseudonymized, then anonymised.<p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><b>Step 1: Pseudonymised Data (Expected to be completed by December 31, 2021)</b><p>
<p>I automatically collect participants’ Prolific IDs. The Prolific ID is collected for two reasons:<p>
<ul>
  <li>Payment of participants after the experiment is conducted.</li>
  <li>Merging participants’ responses with the demographic information participants provided to Prolific. The following default demographic data from Prolific will be merged with the experiment responses: status, age, sex, language, current country of residence, student status, employment status. Providing these data is voluntary and I do not pre-screen on Prolific for complete data.</li>
</ul> 
<p>The pseudonymised data will be stored on servers of the TRR 266 Nextcloud. You can find the contact details of the TRR266 Nextcloud operator below. The data will not be stored outside of the European Union. The data will not be transferred to third parties. There is no automated decision-making or profiling pursuant to Art. 22 EU GDPR.<p>
<p>You can claim the rights granted to you by the EU GDPR insofar as they apply to the processing:<p>
<ul>
  <li>The right to access information on whether and which of your data are being processed in accordance with Art. 15 EU GDPR;</li>
  <li>The right to have personal data that contain inaccurate information about you rectified and completed in accordance with Art. 16 EU GDPR;</li>
  <li>The right to have data relating to you deleted in accordance with Art. 17 EU GDPR;</li>
  <li>The right to demand a limitation of the processing of the data in accordance with Art. 18 EU GDPR;</li>
  <li>The right to transfer data concerning you in accordance with Art. 20 EU GDPR.</li>
</ul> 
<p>You may revoke your consent at any time, in whole or in part. By revoking permission to use the data the user will not question the legality of previous processing of the data (Art. 7 (3) EU-GDPR). In case of revocation, the relevant personal data may no longer be used for the purposes mentioned above in the future and must be erased immediately. As a result, I am no longer allowed to continue processing data based on this consent in the future. If you wish to revoke your consent in whole or in part, please send an e-mail to chaskelr@hu-berlin.de.<p>
<p>The Prolific IDs are stored until payment and data merge are complete. As long as the data are pseudonymised, participants have the above-mentioned rights to access, view, and edit their own pseudonymized information in a timely manner (including the “right to be forgotten”). Please contact me at chaskelr@hu-berlin.de if you wish you access, view, or edit your own information.<p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><b>Step 2: Anonymised Data</b><p>
<p>After completing payment and data merging, the Prolific ID will be deleted and replaced by unique IDs. After that, the data will be fully anonymous. It will not be possible for me or any other person to identify participants.<p>
